# xlFRED
Fetch data from the FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) database to Excel.

No macros, no VBA, just lambda functions!

Build your own spreadsheets wisely as each function calculation is a call to the FRED's web service. Functions also depend on the online availability of the FRED's server.

Requirements: Excel 365 for Windows

**How can I use xlFRED functions in my own workbook?**

Just copy the yellow cells in the worksheet "Menu" to anywhere in your workbook! Then, you can delete the copied cells. Functions will become available!
